This repository is about Hands-on session of GAN(Generative Adversarial Network), Transformer and ViT(Vision Transformer).
1. Create a digit image using GAN algorithm with mnist dataset.
     Goal: To understand structure of generator and discriminator.
           To save and load weighted parameters.
2. Translate Korean to English using Transformer algorithm.
     Goal: To understand structure of tokenization, positional encoding, encoder and decoder.
     Exercise: Translate English to Korean.
3. Classify jets initiated by quarks and gluons using Vision Transformer and CNN algorithm with heatmap(eta, phi) images.
     Goal: To understand structure of CNN and ViT.
           To apply data you have into this model.
